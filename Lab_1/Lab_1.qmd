6.1 Выполениене блока Basic Building Blocks:

```         
| In this lesson, we will explore some basic building blocks of the R programming language.

...

  |===                                                                                                  |   3%
| If at any point you'd like more information on a particular topic related to R, you can type help.start() at
| the prompt, which will open a menu of resources (either within RStudio or your default web browser,
| depending on your setup). Alternatively, a simple web search often yields the answer you're looking for.

...

  |=====                                                                                                |   5%
| In its simplest form, R can be used as an interactive calculator. Type 5 + 7 and press Enter.

> 5+7
[1] 12

| All that hard work is paying off!

  |========                                                                                             |   8%
| R simply prints the result of 12 by default. However, R is a programming language and often the reason we
| use a programming language as opposed to a calculator is to automate some process or avoid unnecessary
| repetition.

...

  |===========                                                                                          |  11%
| In this case, we may want to use our result from above in a second calculation. Instead of retyping 5 + 7
| every time we need it, we can just create a new variable that stores the result.

...

  |=============                                                                                        |  13%
| The way you assign a value to a variable in R is by using the assignment operator, which is just a 'less
| than' symbol followed by a 'minus' sign. It looks like this: <-

...

  |================                                                                                     |  16%
| Think of the assignment operator as an arrow. You are assigning the value on the right side of the arrow to
| the variable name on the left side of the arrow.

...

  |===================                                                                                  |  18%
| To assign the result of 5 + 7 to a new variable called x, you type x <- 5 + 7. This can be read as 'x gets 5
| plus 7'. Give it a try now.

> x <- 5+7

| Excellent job!

  |=====================                                                                                |  21%
| You'll notice that R did not print the result of 12 this time. When you use the assignment operator, R
| assumes that you don't want to see the result immediately, but rather that you intend to use the result for
| something else later on.

...

  |========================                                                                             |  24%
| To view the contents of the variable x, just type x and press Enter. Try it now.

> x
[1] 12

| You're the best!

  |===========================                                                                          |  26%
| Now, store the result of x - 3 in a new variable called y.

> x-3 -> y

| All that hard work is paying off!

  |=============================                                                                        |  29%
| What is the value of y? Type y to find out.

> y
[1] 9

| That's correct!

  |================================                                                                     |  32%
| Now, let's create a small collection of numbers called a vector. Any object that contains data is called a
| data structure and numeric vectors are the simplest type of data structure in R. In fact, even a single
| number is considered a vector of length one.

...

  |===================================                                                                  |  34%
| The easiest way to create a vector is with the c() function, which stands for 'concatenate' or 'combine'. To
| create a vector containing the numbers 1.1, 9, and 3.14, type c(1.1, 9, 3.14). Try it now and store the
| result in a variable called z.

> c(1.1, 9, 3.14) -> z

| You are amazing!

  |=====================================                                                                |  37%
| Anytime you have questions about a particular function, you can access R's built-in help files via the `?`
| command. For example, if you want more information on the c() function, type ?c without the parentheses that
| normally follow a function name. Give it a try.

> ?
+ c

| That's the answer I was looking for.

  |========================================                                                             |  39%
| Type z to view its contents. Notice that there are no commas separating the values in the output.

> z
[1] 1.10 9.00 3.14

| Nice work!

  |===========================================                                                          |  42%
| You can combine vectors to make a new vector. Create a new vector that contains z, 555, then z again in that
| order. Don't assign this vector to a new variable, so that we can just see the result immediately.

> c(z, 555, z)
[1]   1.10   9.00   3.14 555.00   1.10   9.00   3.14

| Excellent job!

  |=============================================                                                        |  45%
| Numeric vectors can be used in arithmetic expressions. Type the following to see what happens: z * 2 + 100.

> z * 2 + 100
[1] 102.20 118.00 106.28

| Excellent work!

  |================================================                                                     |  47%
| First, R multiplied each of the three elements in z by 2. Then it added 100 to each element to get the
| result you see above.

...

  |==================================================                                                   |  50%
| Other common arithmetic operators are `+`, `-`, `/`, and `^` (where x^2 means 'x squared'). To take the
| square root, use the sqrt() function and to take the absolute value, use the abs() function.

...

  |=====================================================                                                |  53%
| Take the square root of z - 1 and assign it to a new variable called my_sqrt.

> my_sqrt <- sqrt(z-1)

| Your dedication is inspiring!

  |========================================================                                             |  55%
| Before we view the contents of the my_sqrt variable, what do you think it contains?

1: a single number (i.e a vector of length 1)
2: a vector of length 0 (i.e. an empty vector)
3: a vector of length 3

Selection: 3

| You're the best!

  |==========================================================                                           |  58%
| Print the contents of my_sqrt.

> my_sqrt
[1] 0.3162278 2.8284271 1.4628739

| You're the best!

  |=============================================================                                        |  61%
| As you may have guessed, R first subtracted 1 from each element of z, then took the square root of each
| element. This leaves you with a vector of the same length as the original vector z.

...

  |================================================================                                     |  63%
| Now, create a new variable called my_div that gets the value of z divided by my_sqrt.

> my_div <- z/my_sqrt

| Keep working like that and you'll get there!

  |==================================================================                                   |  66%
| Which statement do you think is true?

1: The first element of my_div is equal to the first element of z divided by the first element of my_sqrt, and so on...
2: my_div is a single number (i.e a vector of length 1)
3: my_div is undefined

Selection: 1

| That's a job well done!

  |=====================================================================                                |  68%
| Go ahead and print the contents of my_div.

> my_div
[1] 3.478505 3.181981 2.146460

| You got it!

  |========================================================================                             |  71%
| When given two vectors of the same length, R simply performs the specified arithmetic operation (`+`, `-`,
| `*`, etc.) element-by-element. If the vectors are of different lengths, R 'recycles' the shorter vector
| until it is the same length as the longer vector.

...

  |==========================================================================                           |  74%
| When we did z * 2 + 100 in our earlier example, z was a vector of length 3, but technically 2 and 100 are
| each vectors of length 1.

...

  |=============================================================================                        |  76%
| Behind the scenes, R is 'recycling' the 2 to make a vector of 2s and the 100 to make a vector of 100s. In
| other words, when you ask R to compute z * 2 + 100, what it really computes is this: z * c(2, 2, 2) + c(100,
| 100, 100).

...

  |================================================================================                     |  79%
| To see another example of how this vector 'recycling' works, try adding c(1, 2, 3, 4) and c(0, 10). Don't
| worry about saving the result in a new variable.

> c(1,2,3,4)+c(0,10)
[1]  1 12  3 14

| Excellent work!

  |==================================================================================                   |  82%
| If the length of the shorter vector does not divide evenly into the length of the longer vector, R will still apply the 'recycling' method, but will throw a
| warning to let you know something fishy might be going on.

...

  |=====================================================================================                |  84%
| Try c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100) for an example.

> c(1,2,3,4)+c(0,10,100)
[1]   1  12 103   4
Warning message:
In c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100) :
  longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length

| That's a job well done!

  |========================================================================================             |  87%
| Before concluding this lesson, I'd like to show you a couple of time-saving tricks.

...

  |==========================================================================================           |  89%
| Earlier in the lesson, you computed z * 2 + 100. Let's pretend that you made a mistake and that you meant to add 1000 instead of 100. You could either re-type
| the expression, or...

...

  |=============================================================================================        |  92%
| In many programming environments, the up arrow will cycle through previous commands. Try hitting the up arrow on your keyboard until you get to this command
| (z * 2 + 100), then change 100 to 1000 and hit Enter. If the up arrow doesn't work for you, just type the corrected command.

> z * 2 + 1000
[1] 1002.20 1018.00 1006.28

| Your dedication is inspiring!

  |================================================================================================     |  95%
| Finally, let's pretend you'd like to view the contents of a variable that you created earlier, but you can't seem to remember if you named it my_div or myDiv.
| You could try both and see what works, or...

...

  |==================================================================================================   |  97%
| You can type the first two letters of the variable name, then hit the Tab key (possibly more than once). Most programming environments will provide a list of
| variables that you've created that begin with 'my'. This is called auto-completion and can be quite handy when you have many variables in your workspace. Give
| it a try. (If auto-completion doesn't work for you, just type my_div and press Enter.)

| Because different operating systems have different conventions with regards to things like file paths, the outputs of these commands may vary across machines.

...

  |========                                                                                                                                               |   5%
| However it's important to note that R provides a common API (a common set of commands) for interacting with files, that way your code will work across
| different kinds of computers.

| It is often helpful to save the settings that you had before you began an analysis and then go back to them at the end. This trick is often used within

| The simplest way to create a sequence of numbers in R is by using the `:` operator. Type 1:20 to see how it works.

> 1:20
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20

| You got it!

  |=============                                                                                                                                          |   9%
| That gave us every integer between (and including) 1 and 20. We could also use it to create a sequence of real numbers. For example, try pi:10.

> pi:10
[1] 3.141593 4.141593 5.141593 6.141593 7.141593 8.141593 9.141593

| You are really on a roll!

| The result is a vector of real numbers starting with pi (3.142...) and increasing in increments of 1. The upper limit of 10 is never reached, since the next
| number in our sequence would be greater than 10.

| It counted backwards in increments of 1! It's unlikely we'd want this behavior, but nonetheless it's good to know how it could happen.

...

  |=======================================                                                                                                                |  26%
| Remember that if you have questions about a particular R function, you can access its documentation with a question mark followed by the function name:
| ?function_name_here. However, in the case of an operator like the colon used above, you must enclose the symbol in backticks like this: ?`:`. (NOTE: The
| backtick (`) key is generally located in the top left corner of a keyboard, above the Tab key. If you don't have a backtick key, you can use regular quotes.)

...

  |==============================================                                                                                                         |  30%
| Pull up the documentation for `:` now.

> ?`:`

| That's the answer I was looking for.

  |=====================================================                                                                                                  |  35%
| Often, we'll desire more control over a sequence we're creating than what the `:` operator gives us. The seq() function serves this purpose.

...

 |===========================================================                                                                                            |  39%
| The most basic use of seq() does exactly the same thing as the `:` operator. Try seq(1, 20) to see this.

> seq(1,20)
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20

| Perseverance, that's the answer.

  |==================================================================                                                                                     |  43%
| This gives us the same output as 1:20. However, let's say that instead we want a vector of numbers ranging from 0 to 10, incremented by 0.5. seq(0, 10,
| by=0.5) does just that. Try it out.

> seq(0,10,by=0.5)
 [1]  0.0  0.5  1.0  1.5  2.0  2.5  3.0  3.5  4.0  4.5  5.0  5.5  6.0  6.5  7.0  7.5  8.0  8.5  9.0  9.5 10.0

| Excellent job!

  |========================================================================                                                                               |  48%
| Or maybe we don't care what the increment is and we just want a sequence of 30 numbers between 5 and 10. seq(5, 10, length=30) does the trick. Give it a shot
| now and store the result in a new variable called my_seq.

> my_seq <- seq(5,10,length=30)

| You got it right!

  |===============================================================================                                                                        |  52%
| To confirm that my_seq has length 30, we can use the length() function. Try it now.

> length(my_seq)
[1] 30

| You're the best!

  |=====================================================================================                                                                  |  57%
| Let's pretend we don't know the length of my_seq, but we want to generate a sequence of integers from 1 to N, where N represents the length of the my_seq
| vector. In other words, we want a new vector (1, 2, 3, ...) that is the same length as my_seq.

...

  |============================================================================================                                                           |  61%
| There are several ways we could do this. One possibility is to combine the `:` operator and the length() function like this: 1:length(my_seq). Give that a

| Another option is to use seq(along.with = my_seq). Give that a try.

> seq(along.with = my_seq)
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30

| Keep up the great work!

| However, as is the case with many common tasks, R has a separate built-in function for this purpose called seq_along(). Type seq_along(my_seq) to see it in
| action.

> seq_along(my_seq)
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30

| That's correct!

| There are often several approaches to solving the same problem, particularly in R. Simple approaches that involve less typing are generally best. It's also
| important for your code to be readable, so that you and others can figure out what's going on without too much hassle.

| If R has a built-in function for a particular task, it's likely that function is highly optimized for that purpose and is your best option. As you become a
| more advanced R programmer, you'll design your own functions to perform tasks when there are no better options. We'll explore writing your own functions in
| future lessons.

| One more function related to creating sequences of numbers is rep(), which stands for 'replicate'. Let's look at a few uses.

| If we're interested in creating a vector that contains 40 zeros, we can use rep(0, times = 40). Try it out.

> rep(0, times=40)
 [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

| You are really on a roll!

  |==========================================================================================================================================             |  91%
| If instead we want our vector to contain 10 repetitions of the vector (0, 1, 2), we can do rep(c(0, 1, 2), times = 10). Go ahead.

> rep(c(0,1,2), times=10)
 [1] 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2

| Keep working like that and you'll get there!

  |================================================================================================================================================       |  96%
| Finally, let's say that rather than repeating the vector (0, 1, 2) over and over again, we want our vector to contain 10 zeros, then 10 ones, then 10 twos. We
| can do this with the `each` argument. Try rep(c(0, 1, 2), each = 10).

> rep(c(0,1,2),each=10)
 [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
