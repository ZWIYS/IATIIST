6.1 Выполениене блока Basic Building Blocks:

```         
| In this lesson, we will explore some basic building blocks of the R programming language.

...

  |===                                                                                                  |   3%
| If at any point you'd like more information on a particular topic related to R, you can type help.start() at
| the prompt, which will open a menu of resources (either within RStudio or your default web browser,
| depending on your setup). Alternatively, a simple web search often yields the answer you're looking for.

...

  |=====                                                                                                |   5%
| In its simplest form, R can be used as an interactive calculator. Type 5 + 7 and press Enter.

> 5+7
[1] 12

| All that hard work is paying off!

  |========                                                                                             |   8%
| R simply prints the result of 12 by default. However, R is a programming language and often the reason we
| use a programming language as opposed to a calculator is to automate some process or avoid unnecessary
| repetition.

...

  |===========                                                                                          |  11%
| In this case, we may want to use our result from above in a second calculation. Instead of retyping 5 + 7
| every time we need it, we can just create a new variable that stores the result.

...

  |=============                                                                                        |  13%
| The way you assign a value to a variable in R is by using the assignment operator, which is just a 'less
| than' symbol followed by a 'minus' sign. It looks like this: <-

...

  |================                                                                                     |  16%
| Think of the assignment operator as an arrow. You are assigning the value on the right side of the arrow to
| the variable name on the left side of the arrow.

...

  |===================                                                                                  |  18%
| To assign the result of 5 + 7 to a new variable called x, you type x <- 5 + 7. This can be read as 'x gets 5
| plus 7'. Give it a try now.

> x <- 5+7

| Excellent job!

  |=====================                                                                                |  21%
| You'll notice that R did not print the result of 12 this time. When you use the assignment operator, R
| assumes that you don't want to see the result immediately, but rather that you intend to use the result for
| something else later on.

...

  |========================                                                                             |  24%
| To view the contents of the variable x, just type x and press Enter. Try it now.

> x
[1] 12

| You're the best!

  |===========================                                                                          |  26%
| Now, store the result of x - 3 in a new variable called y.

> x-3 -> y

| All that hard work is paying off!

  |=============================                                                                        |  29%
| What is the value of y? Type y to find out.

> y
[1] 9

| That's correct!

  |================================                                                                     |  32%
| Now, let's create a small collection of numbers called a vector. Any object that contains data is called a
| data structure and numeric vectors are the simplest type of data structure in R. In fact, even a single
| number is considered a vector of length one.

...

  |===================================                                                                  |  34%
| The easiest way to create a vector is with the c() function, which stands for 'concatenate' or 'combine'. To
| create a vector containing the numbers 1.1, 9, and 3.14, type c(1.1, 9, 3.14). Try it now and store the
| result in a variable called z.

> c(1.1, 9, 3.14) -> z

| You are amazing!

  |=====================================                                                                |  37%
| Anytime you have questions about a particular function, you can access R's built-in help files via the `?`
| command. For example, if you want more information on the c() function, type ?c without the parentheses that
| normally follow a function name. Give it a try.

> ?
+ c

| That's the answer I was looking for.

  |========================================                                                             |  39%
| Type z to view its contents. Notice that there are no commas separating the values in the output.

> z
[1] 1.10 9.00 3.14

| Nice work!

  |===========================================                                                          |  42%
| You can combine vectors to make a new vector. Create a new vector that contains z, 555, then z again in that
| order. Don't assign this vector to a new variable, so that we can just see the result immediately.

> c(z, 555, z)
[1]   1.10   9.00   3.14 555.00   1.10   9.00   3.14

| Excellent job!

  |=============================================                                                        |  45%
| Numeric vectors can be used in arithmetic expressions. Type the following to see what happens: z * 2 + 100.

> z * 2 + 100
[1] 102.20 118.00 106.28

| Excellent work!

  |================================================                                                     |  47%
| First, R multiplied each of the three elements in z by 2. Then it added 100 to each element to get the
| result you see above.

...

  |==================================================                                                   |  50%
| Other common arithmetic operators are `+`, `-`, `/`, and `^` (where x^2 means 'x squared'). To take the
| square root, use the sqrt() function and to take the absolute value, use the abs() function.

...

  |=====================================================                                                |  53%
| Take the square root of z - 1 and assign it to a new variable called my_sqrt.

> my_sqrt <- sqrt(z-1)

| Your dedication is inspiring!

  |========================================================                                             |  55%
| Before we view the contents of the my_sqrt variable, what do you think it contains?

1: a single number (i.e a vector of length 1)
2: a vector of length 0 (i.e. an empty vector)
3: a vector of length 3

Selection: 3

| You're the best!

  |==========================================================                                           |  58%
| Print the contents of my_sqrt.

> my_sqrt
[1] 0.3162278 2.8284271 1.4628739

| You're the best!

  |=============================================================                                        |  61%
| As you may have guessed, R first subtracted 1 from each element of z, then took the square root of each
| element. This leaves you with a vector of the same length as the original vector z.

...

  |================================================================                                     |  63%
| Now, create a new variable called my_div that gets the value of z divided by my_sqrt.

> my_div <- z/my_sqrt

| Keep working like that and you'll get there!

  |==================================================================                                   |  66%
| Which statement do you think is true?

1: The first element of my_div is equal to the first element of z divided by the first element of my_sqrt, and so on...
2: my_div is a single number (i.e a vector of length 1)
3: my_div is undefined

Selection: 1

| That's a job well done!

  |=====================================================================                                |  68%
| Go ahead and print the contents of my_div.

> my_div
[1] 3.478505 3.181981 2.146460

| You got it!

  |========================================================================                             |  71%
| When given two vectors of the same length, R simply performs the specified arithmetic operation (`+`, `-`,
| `*`, etc.) element-by-element. If the vectors are of different lengths, R 'recycles' the shorter vector
| until it is the same length as the longer vector.

...

  |==========================================================================                           |  74%
| When we did z * 2 + 100 in our earlier example, z was a vector of length 3, but technically 2 and 100 are
| each vectors of length 1.

...

  |=============================================================================                        |  76%
| Behind the scenes, R is 'recycling' the 2 to make a vector of 2s and the 100 to make a vector of 100s. In
| other words, when you ask R to compute z * 2 + 100, what it really computes is this: z * c(2, 2, 2) + c(100,
| 100, 100).

...

  |================================================================================                     |  79%
| To see another example of how this vector 'recycling' works, try adding c(1, 2, 3, 4) and c(0, 10). Don't
| worry about saving the result in a new variable.

> c(1,2,3,4)+c(0,10)
[1]  1 12  3 14

| Excellent work!

  |==================================================================================                   |  82%
| If the length of the shorter vector does not divide evenly into the length of the longer vector, R will still apply the 'recycling' method, but will throw a
| warning to let you know something fishy might be going on.

...

  |=====================================================================================                |  84%
| Try c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100) for an example.

> c(1,2,3,4)+c(0,10,100)
[1]   1  12 103   4
Warning message:
In c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100) :
  longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length

| That's a job well done!

  |========================================================================================             |  87%
| Before concluding this lesson, I'd like to show you a couple of time-saving tricks.

...

  |==========================================================================================           |  89%
| Earlier in the lesson, you computed z * 2 + 100. Let's pretend that you made a mistake and that you meant to add 1000 instead of 100. You could either re-type
| the expression, or...

...

  |=============================================================================================        |  92%
| In many programming environments, the up arrow will cycle through previous commands. Try hitting the up arrow on your keyboard until you get to this command
| (z * 2 + 100), then change 100 to 1000 and hit Enter. If the up arrow doesn't work for you, just type the corrected command.

> z * 2 + 1000
[1] 1002.20 1018.00 1006.28

| Your dedication is inspiring!

  |================================================================================================     |  95%
| Finally, let's pretend you'd like to view the contents of a variable that you created earlier, but you can't seem to remember if you named it my_div or myDiv.
| You could try both and see what works, or...

...

  |==================================================================================================   |  97%
| You can type the first two letters of the variable name, then hit the Tab key (possibly more than once). Most programming environments will provide a list of
| variables that you've created that begin with 'my'. This is called auto-completion and can be quite handy when you have many variables in your workspace. Give
| it a try. (If auto-completion doesn't work for you, just type my_div and press Enter.)

| Because different operating systems have different conventions with regards to things like file paths, the outputs of these commands may vary across machines.

...

  |========                                                                                                                                               |   5%
| However it's important to note that R provides a common API (a common set of commands) for interacting with files, that way your code will work across
| different kinds of computers.

| Some R commands are the same as their equivalents commands on Linux or on a Mac. Both Linux and Mac operating systems are based on an operating system called
| Unix. It's always a good idea to learn more about Unix!

| Now take a look at objects that are in your workspace using ls().

> ls()
[1] "my_div"  "my_sqrt" "x"       "y"       "z"      

| Perseverance, that's the answer.

| List all the files in your working directory using list.files() or dir().

> dir()
[1] "Lab_1"

| That's the answer I was looking for.

  |=======================================                                                                                                                |  26%
| As we go through this lesson, you should be examining the help page for each new function. Check out the help page for list.files with the command
| ?list.files

> ?list.files

| You're the best!

  |===========================================                                                                                                            |  28%
| One of the most helpful parts of any R help file is the See Also section. Read that section for list.files. Some of these functions may be used in later
| portions of this lesson.

...

  |==============================================                                                                                                         |  31%
| Using the args() function on a function name is also a handy way to see what arguments a function can take.

...

  |==================================================                                                                                                     |  33%
| Use the args() function to determine the arguments to list.files().

> args(list.files)
function (path = ".", pattern = NULL, all.files = FALSE, full.names = FALSE, 
    recursive = FALSE, ignore.case = FALSE, include.dirs = FALSE, 
    no.. = FALSE) 
NULL

| You are quite good my friend!

  |======================================================                                                                                                 |  36%
| Assign the value of the current working directory to a variable called "old.dir".

> old.dir <- getwd()

| That's correct!

  |==========================================================                                                                                             |  38%
| We will use old.dir at the end of this lesson to move back to the place that we started. A lot of query functions like getwd() have the useful property that
| they return the answer to the question as a result of the function.

...

  |==============================================================                                                                                         |  41%
| Use dir.create() to create a directory in the current working directory called "testdir".

> dir.create("testdir")

| That's the answer I was looking for.

  |==================================================================                                                                                     |  44%
| We will do all our work in this new directory and then delete it after we are done. This is the R analog to "Take only pictures, leave only footprints."

...

  |======================================================================                                                                                 |  46%
| Set your working directory to "testdir" with the setwd() command.

> setwd("testdir")

| You nailed it! Good job!

| In general, you will want your working directory to be someplace sensible, perhaps created for the specific project that you are working on. In fact,
| organizing your work in R packages using RStudio is an excellent option. Check out RStudio at http://www.rstudio.com/

  |=============================================================================                                                                          |  51%
| Create a file in your working directory called "mytest.R" using the file.create() function.

> file.create("mytest.R")
[1] TRUE

| You got it right!

  |=================================================================================                                                                      |  54%
| This should be the only file in this newly created directory. Let's check this by listing all the files in the current directory.

> list.files()
[1] "mytest.R"

| You got it right!

  |=====================================================================================                                                                  |  56%
| Check to see if "mytest.R" exists in the working directory using the file.exists() function.

> file.exists("mytest.R")
[1] TRUE

| You got it right!

  |=========================================================================================                                                              |  59%
| These sorts of functions are excessive for interactive use. But, if you are running a program that loops through a series of files and does some processing on
| each one, you will want to check to see that each exists before you try to process it.

...

  |=============================================================================================                                                          |  62%

| Your operating system will provide simpler tools for these sorts of tasks, but having the ability to manipulate files programatically is useful. You might now
| try to delete mytest.R using file.remove('mytest.R'), but that won't work since mytest.R no longer exists. You have already renamed it.

| You now have two files in the current directory. That may not seem very interesting. But what if you were working with dozens, or millions, of individual
| files? In that case, being able to programatically act on many files would be absolutely necessary. Don't forget that you can, temporarily, leave the lesson
| by typing play() and then return by typing nxt().

| Provide the relative path to the file "mytest3.R" by using file.path().

> file.path("mytest3.R")

| You can use file.path to construct file and directory paths that are independent of the operating system your R code is running on. Pass 'folder1' and
| 'folder2' as arguments to file.path to make a platform-independent pathname.

> file.path('folder1', 'folder2')
[1] "folder1/folder2"

| Nice work!

| Take a look at the documentation for dir.create by entering ?dir.create . Notice the 'recursive' argument. In order to create nested directories, 'recursive'
| must be set to TRUE.

> ?dir.create

  |================================================================================================================================                       |  85%
| Create a directory in the current working directory called "testdir2" and a subdirectory for it called "testdir3", all in one command by using dir.create()
| and file.path().

> dir.create(file.path('testdir2', 'testdir3'), recursive = TRUE)

| That's the answer I was looking for.

| Go back to your original working directory using setwd(). (Recall that we created the variable old.dir with the full path for the orginal working directory at
| the start of these questions.)

| It is often helpful to save the settings that you had before you began an analysis and then go back to them at the end. This trick is often used within
| functions; you save, say, the par() settings that you started with, mess around a bunch, and then set them back to the original values at the end. This isn't
| the same as what we have done here, but it seems similar enough to mention.
